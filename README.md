# Yoga_asana_prediction

This repo contains my streamlit app that predicts a yoga asana from an image.

Until now the model has been trained with images of 5 different yoga asanas: **Downward facing dog, Goddess Pose, Plank Pose (and side plank variations), Tree pose and Warrior 2**.

I used a Convolutional Neurtal Network to classify the asanas. So far my model predicts the correct asana from my test images with an **accuracy of 91%**.
